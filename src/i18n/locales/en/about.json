    "Hi, I'm Natán. I like building software that solves real problems and feels neat, clear, and maintainable. I really enjoy the process, understanding what's needed, thinking of a simple solution, and turning it into something that works well.",
    "I'm driven by curiosity and continuous learning. I'm always exploring new ideas, tools, or ways to do things better. I feel comfortable adapting, asking questions, researching, and breaking whatever it takes to understand it.",
    "Outside of code, I've been a musician since I was a kid. Music helps me stay creative, unwind, and see things from a different angle. I also love animals; playing with \"Clarita\" always recharges my batteries.",
    "I'm looking for projects and opportunities where I can truly add value, work with good people, and continue growing both technically and personally."
